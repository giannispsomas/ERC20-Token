## ERC-20 Token

**This is a simple ERC-20 token, using the Foundry framework, and without making use of libraries**

It consists of:

-   Coded the token from scratch (gave it a name and a symbol).
-   Created a simple deploy script for the contract (it is not deployed).
-   Used Foundry for testing the contract.

### Purpose
